cromlech.marshallers
====================

`cromlech.marshallers` provides a collection of independant
uniformized marshallers, to use in data manipulation and persistence.

Marshallers using third party libraries use conditionnal import.
Check the `setup.py` `extra_requires` to include them transparently.
